Dependencies / Pre-Requisites
-----------------------------
•  Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015

If the PC does not have Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 installed, Visual C++ Redistributable is required. Users can download this from: 

https://www.microsoft.com/en-sg/download/details.aspx?id=48145

•  Windows 10 Universe C Runtime

ESD has run-time dependency on Windows 10 Universe C Runtime (CRT). You may download it from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48234 and install on your PC should the following problem be encountered: 

 
Figure 3 - Screen Designer - System Error

•  FT9XX Tool Chain Version 2.4.0 or later

To compile and build projects, the FT9XX Tool Chain 2.4.0 or later version must be installed on the PC.  It is downloadable from https://brtchip.com/ft9xx-toolchain/ .

Please ensure that the Tool Chain executable path is defined by the system PATH environment variable.
Users are advised to check the known issues and limitations (of FT9XX Toolchain) while building the ESD project with FT9XX Toolchain. The respective FT9XX Toolchain package version release note contains the list of known issues and limitations.

For ESD, we recommend users to install FT9XX Tool Chain version 2.5.0 or later version for the best results. 

•  Raspberry Pi Pico Tool Chain

To compile and build Pico projects, several tool chains must be installed on the PC.
They are: Pico-SDK, python 3.8, GNU Embedded Toolchain for Arm and Cmake. They can be downloaded/cloned from the following:
  Pico-SDK - https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk
  Python 3.8 - https://www.python.org/downloads/
  GNU Embedded Toolchain - https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/gnu-rm
  CMake - https://cmake.org/download/

ESD will check system environment variables to find these tool chains, and it also provides a user dialog to configure the tool chain path under Tools menu:
